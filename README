About Memcache
--------------

Memcache is a server designed to store key=>value pairs in memory.

Memcache has no support for namespace but using a special naming
convention and one extra variable we can create some sort of
virtual namespaces. 

Why have namespace?
-------------------

Because it's nice to fine-grained cache invalidation control.
